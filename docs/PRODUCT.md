# Loci — Product Rules & Business Logic

Loci is a Telegram Mini App where people pin meaningful life moments to
real places on an interactive world map — a living, collective archive of
human memories, not a social network.

## Design principles (hard constraints)

- Map-first; stories are always the focus
- Minimal, clean UI; fast interactions, smooth animations
- One-tap publishing
- Privacy-first: exact location optional, anonymous posting available

## Categories

Twelve fixed categories, seeded in the database (Phase 2). Accent colors and
marker glyphs are defined in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

Love · Happy Moments · Dreams · Education · Career · Travel · Friendship ·
Childhood · Achievements · Beautiful Places · Memories · Urban Legends

## Story fields

category, title, short story, photos (optional), date (optional), location
(approx or exact), reactions, comments, visibility (public/private), author
or anonymous.

## Screens

- **Home** — map, search, filters, nearby, trending
- **Story** — photos, text, category, author, reactions, comments, share
- **Add Story** — location → category → title → story → photos → visibility → publish
- **Profile** — created, saved, visited, stats, achievements

## MVP scope

In: interactive map, add markers, categories, story page, photos, comments,
reactions, search, user profiles, report path.

Out (keep schema extensible, don't build): collections, AI summaries,
timeline mode, memory routes, travel mode, heatmap, follow, verification,
badges, global stats.

## Domain invariants

| Domain | Invariant |
|---|---|
| Auth | Telegram `initData` HMAC-validated server-side on every request; reject stale/replayed payloads; `core/security/telegram.py` |
| Location privacy | Approximate mode fuzzes coordinates **server-side** before storage; fuzzed and exact coords stored in separate columns; exact never returned when approx was chosen, at any layer |
| Anonymous stories | Author ID never present in any API response for anonymous stories — not in JSON, not in logs, not in websocket/notification payloads |
| Visibility | Private stories only returned to their author; re-checked on every read, not trusted from client |
| Reactions/Comments | Rate-limited per user per story; author of a story cannot be inferred from reaction counts on anonymous stories |
| Media | Object storage holds bytes; PostgreSQL owns metadata and moderation state; presigned URLs scoped + expiring |
| Moderation | Every story/comment has a report path from day one, even if the review UI is manual (admin script) in MVP |

## Policy decisions (approved 2026-07-10)

### Location fuzzing
- Approximate mode: random offset within a **250–750 m ring** around the
  exact point, computed server-side before storage.
- Deterministic per (story ID, exact point): the offset is derived from
  HMAC-SHA256 keyed by `LOCATION_FUZZ_SECRET`, so the marker never drifts
  between requests **and** repeated precision toggles yield the same single
  sample — averaging re-fuzzes can't converge on the exact point.
  Implementation: `backend/app/core/security/geo.py`.
- Exact and fuzzed coordinates live in separate columns; when the author
  chose approximate, the exact column is never serialized in any response,
  log, or payload.

### Photos
- Max **5 photos per story**, max **10 MB per file** before processing.
- Accepted upload types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC.
- Async re-encode after upload (Celery): WebP, max edge 2048 px, plus a
  thumbnail; originals are not served.
- Presigned PUT URLs: scoped to a single object key, expire in **10 minutes**.
- The completion endpoint checks the stored object size before queueing work;
  files over 10 MB are deleted and marked failed. The worker decodes the bytes
  (including HEIC) before producing served WebP variants.

### Moderation
- `reports` exist for stories and comments from day one.
- Content auto-hides at **5 unique reporters**, pending manual review
  (admin script in MVP). Nothing is auto-deleted.

### Rate limits (per user, Redis-backed)
| Action | Limit |
|---|---|
| Auth (per IP, transport-level) | 10 / min |
| Create story | 10 / day |
| Comment | 10 / min |
| Reaction | 30 / min |
| Report | 20 / day |
| Request upload URL | 20 / hour |

### Auth thresholds
- `initData` with `auth_date` older than **300 s** rejected (same bound the
  `wished` production config enforces).
- Replayed `initData` hashes rejected via Redis guard.
- JWT: access **15 min**, refresh **30 days** with rotation.

### Reactions (decided 2026-07-10)
- Single reaction kind, `heart`; tap to toggle. One reaction per user per
  story (`(story_id, user_id)` primary key).
- The `type` column exists with default `'heart'` so adding kinds later is
  a data change, not a migration.

### Text limits (decided 2026-07-10)
- Story title ≤ **120** chars, body ≤ **4000** chars — enforced at the API
  boundary (Phase 4); DB columns are `text`, so limits can change without a
  migration.

### Localization
- Locales: `en`, `kk`, `ru` (Kazakh uses ISO 639-1 code `kk`).
- Auto-selected from Telegram `language_code`, falling back to `en`.

## API contract (grows per phase; never extended without documenting here first)

### Auth (Phase 3)
| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/auth/telegram` | Body `{init_data}`. HMAC-validates, rejects stale (>300 s), future-dated, and replayed payloads; upserts the user from the Telegram payload; returns access JWT + user, sets httpOnly `refresh_token` cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth` |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` | Rotates the refresh token from the cookie: old one revoked, new one issued. Revoked/expired/unknown tokens → 401 and cookie cleared |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` | Revokes the cookie's refresh token, clears the cookie, 204 |

Protected endpoints (Phase 4+) authenticate via `Authorization: Bearer <access>`
resolved by `app/api/deps.py:get_current_user`. Public reads accept an optional
bearer token (`get_optional_user`) — a bad token is rejected, not ignored.

### Core API (Phase 4)

Write endpoints are rate-limited per user (table above). Story/comment reads
re-check visibility on the server for every request.

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/categories` | 12 seeded categories with slug/color/icon/position |
| `POST /api/v1/stories` | Create; validates category, title ≤120, body ≤4000, lat/lon ranges; approx mode fuzzes server-side before the point is readable; enforces 10/day |
| `GET /api/v1/stories/{id}` | Story with author (null when anonymous), public point only, counts, viewer flags, ready photos via presigned GETs |
| `DELETE /api/v1/stories/{id}` | Author only; cascades photos/comments/reactions/bookmarks/reports |
| `GET /api/v1/stories/nearby?lat&lon&radius_meters&category_id&limit` | Geography-cast `ST_DWithin` (metric, antimeridian-safe), ordered by distance |
| `GET /api/v1/stories/bbox?min_lat&min_lon&max_lat&max_lon&category_id&limit` | Viewport query for the map |
| `GET /api/v1/stories/trending?limit` | Ordered by reactions+comments, then recency |
| `GET /api/v1/stories/search?q&limit` | ILIKE over title+body; respects visibility |
| `GET/POST /api/v1/stories/{id}/comments` | List (hidden excluded) / create (≤1000 chars) |
| `DELETE /api/v1/comments/{id}` | Comment author only |
| `POST/DELETE /api/v1/stories/{id}/reactions` | Idempotent heart toggle |
| `POST/DELETE /api/v1/stories/{id}/bookmark` | Idempotent bookmark toggle |
| `POST /api/v1/stories/{id}/report`, `POST /api/v1/comments/{id}/report` | One report per user per target; auto-hide at threshold of distinct non-author reporters |
| `POST /api/v1/stories/{id}/photos` | Author only; ≤5 photos; returns single-key presigned PUT (10 min) |
| `POST /api/v1/stories/{id}/photos/{photo_id}/complete` | Author confirms upload; queues Celery WebP re-encode (2048 px + thumb); original deleted after |
| `GET /api/v1/profile/me` · `/me/stories` · `/me/bookmarks` | Own profile; own list includes anonymous stories (only there) |

## Edge cases (grows as phases land)

- A user switches a story from exact to approximate: the exact column must
  be re-fuzzed and the previously public exact point treated as compromised
  (no re-publishing it later).
- Anonymous story by a user who later deletes their account: story remains,
  still unlinkable.
- Reports by the story's own author don't count toward auto-hide.
- Stories at the antimeridian / poles: geometry queries must not assume a
  simple bounding box.
